# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning 📧🚫

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based Email Spam Detection System to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham). The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses NLP techniques and classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in identifying spam emails.

Features ✨
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning (removal of punctuation, stop words, and special characters).
Tokenization and vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
Model Training:

Comparison of classification models such as:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Fine-tuning for optimal performance.
Evaluation:

Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Visualization:

Graphs and charts for data insights, including spam vs. ham emails distribution.
Deployment-Ready:

Export of the trained model for integration into web or desktop applications.
Dataset 📂
The project uses the SpamAssassin Public Corpus or publicly available datasets for training and evaluation.

How to Use 🛠️
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-detection.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook spam_detection.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.
Technologies Used 🖥️
Python: Core programming language.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
